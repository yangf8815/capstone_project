Electric vehicle (EV) ownership in New South Wales (NSW) is accelerating rapidly, yet the expansion of public charging infrastructure has not kept pace with this demand. Many suburbs lack convenient access to public charging stations, creating what are often called “charging deserts.” This imbalance presents a barrier to broader EV adoption, particularly for drivers without access to private home chargers. The opportunity lies in using data-driven analysis to identify optimal areas for new charger installations, thereby improving accessibility, reducing travel distance to chargers, and supporting the state’s transition to sustainable transport. Addressing this issue is valuable both economically and environmentally — ensuring equitable access to charging can increase EV adoption rates, support emissions reduction targets, and boost infrastructure investment efficiency. Currently, the lack of chargers in high-demand areas leads to consumer dissatisfaction, longer wait times, and inefficient utilisation of existing infrastructure. The desired state is a well-planned, equitable charging network aligned with current and projected demand patterns. Previous research has explored charger location optimisation, but most have used broad regional data or static spatial models. This project builds upon and extends that work by creating a machine learning–based, postcode-level framework that predicts both the need for chargers and optimal capacity, filling a critical gap in existing research.
